# 🧠 Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my collection of practical machine learning projects!  
This repository showcases real-world applications of machine learning — covering data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and deployment.

## 🔍 What's Inside

- 📈 **Regression** – Predictive models for continuous outcomes  
- 🗂️ **Classification** – Identifying categories or labels  
- 💬 **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** – Text analysis and sentiment detection  
- 🔢 **Clustering & Dimensionality Reduction** – Uncover hidden patterns  
- 📊 **Time Series Forecasting** – Predict future trends

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python 🐍  
- NumPy, pandas  
- scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🚀 Projects Structure

Each project has its own folder and typically contains:

- `README.md` – Project overview  
- `.ipynb` or `.py` – Main code/notebook  
- `data/` – Sample or real-world dataset  
- `results/` – Visualizations or model output

## 🤝 Contributions

Feel free to fork the repo, open issues, or suggest improvements. Let’s learn together!
